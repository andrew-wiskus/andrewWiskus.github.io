    <h4>Education</h4> <hr>
    <li>Virginia Commonwealth University, in Richmond, Virginia. 2011-2015 </li> 
    <li>Was rated number one public graphic design program by USNews in 2011. </li> 
    <li>Seeking a Bachelors of Interdisciplinary Science: Interaction Design. </li> <br> 
 
      I studied design in all of its forms. Within their design curriculum the classes I took included: Typography, Interaction Design, System Design, Form and Function, Photography, Philosophy and History of Design, Design Technology, Space(3D design), Sequential Design, Surface Design. Designing for these classes 30+ hours a week I became a near expert using software such as Adobe Photoshop, Indesign, Illustrator, Lightroom, and Edge. I could talk about these classes all day if you'd ask, I am very grateful for the quality of education I received. I then took a full year of classes within the psychology department to better understand how people learn and interact with educational tools. The classes where I learned these concepts the most included: Cognitive Processes, Learning and Cognition, Perception, Lifespan Development. I plan on taking computer science classes at an in-state university and obtaining a degree over the next few years.

    <h4>Internship Experience</h4> <hr>
    <p>For the majority of my 2014 summer, I worked 25hrs a week at <a href="http://haberdash.us/" target="_blank">Haberdash</a> in Richmond during my junior year at VCU. As an in-house designer my responsibilities included but were not limited to:</p>
     <li> Working with clients directly to conceive designs from scratch, either over the phone, email, or in person when clients would come into the store for a meeting. </li>
      <li> Maintain communication through email and phone conversations with my clients as well as my coworkers to reach deadlines and produce content accurately. </li> 
      <li> Take content provided by clients as a style guideline such as photographs, designs, or artwork they would find on the internet that inspired their idea. </li> 
      <li> Manipulate finished designs so they would seamlessly fit on items such as shirts, jackets, pants, hats, bags, signs, banners, brochures, posters, and canvas prints. </li>

    <h4>Work History</h4> <hr>
    <p>I’ve been working in restaurants for seven years, getting my first job at age 16. Businesses such as Perkins, Jimmy Johns, Chipotle, TapHouse Bar and Grill, Graffito's, Applebees, and Basils Pizza. I’ve worked almost every position as well and wore multiple hats in a majority of the restaurants I’ve been a part of. From dishwashing to cooking, hosting to serving, I’ve even held leadership positions though never having the title of assistant manager. I prided myself on my customer service skills and worked hard to maintain a clean, fast, and mistake-free environment in all the restaurants I’ve worked at. 
       I’m currently working at Basils Pizza in Northfield Minnesota where I wait tables, deliver, prepare food, and cook. I also have and have responsibility throughout the shift of making sure all prep gets done by my coworkers for the next day and to communicate to the staff what needs to be done on the days I'm not working. I’m responsible for checking on our stock and helping order ingredients we’re low on. I also have a large hand in training our new employees since I’m very experienced in every aspect of our restaurant and know exactly how my 81-year-old Greek boss wants jobs completed, so I take it upon myself to make sure newcomers know “The Basils Way”.
